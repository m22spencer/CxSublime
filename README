A quickly thrown together plugin for haxe development in sublime.


It's not feature complete, and has some bugs but is usable.


to install: 
1. Open sublime
2. Navigate to Packages dir in shell ("Browse Packages" to find path)
3. git clone git@github.com:m22spencer/CxSublime.git HaXe


Configuration options:

in your User keymaps bind the following:

[
	{"keys":["f6"], "command":"haxe_build_tool"},
	{"keys":["f5"], "command":"haxe_build"}
]

F6 will open the configurable build tool, F5 will build.

Autocomplete is based entirely off a project.hxml in your first open sublime folder.

More to come soon, sorry, I'm in a hurry tonight.
