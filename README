A quickly thrown together plugin for haxe development in sublime.


It's not feature complete, and has some bugs but is usable.


to install: 
1. Open sublime
2. Navigate to Packages dir in shell ("Browse Packages" to find path)
3. git clone git@github.com:m22spencer/CxSublime.git Haxe


Configuration options:

in your User keymaps bind the following (Or whichever you choose to use):

[
    {"keys":["f5"], "command":"haxe_build"},
	{"keys":["f6"], "command":"haxe_build_tool"},
    {"keys":["ctrl+i"], "command": "haxe_generate_import"}
]

F6 will open the configurable build file select, F5 will build.

ctrl+i will do a very... dumb generate import. It has basic guards against duplicates, 
but does not check to see if the type actually exists before importing.

Autocomplete is based entirely off your currently selected .hxml file (f6)
