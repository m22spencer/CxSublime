A quickly thrown together plugin for haxe development in sublime.

KNOWN BUGS:
    Windows: exec fails with certain versions of python due to no piping the output.
                    This requires a patch to the sublime exec.py with stederr=PIPE
    Linux: Some versions of linux/py will not work properly with xmltree.


to install: 
1. Open sublime
2. Navigate to Packages dir in shell ("Browse Packages" to find path)
3. git clone git://github.com/m22spencer/CxSublime.git Haxe

Configuration options:

in your User keymaps bind the following (Or whichever you choose to use):

[
    {"keys":["f5"], "command":"haxe_build"},
    {"keys":["f6"], "command":"haxe_build_tool"},
    {"keys":["ctrl+i"], "command": "haxe_generate_import"}
]

The build tool will recursively scan ALL folders in the sidebar of sublime.
    It will use the directory of the currently selected .hxml as a working directory.


ctrl+i will do a very... dumb generate import. It has basic guards against duplicates, 
but does not check to see if the type actually exists before importing.

Autocomplete is based entirely off your currently selected .hxml file (f6)
